# recruiter-response-template

Your time is limited and valuable. You also have the nicest of problems to have - **too many recruiters reach out to you and you spend a significant time to write the responses**. This repository contains a collection of ready-to-use responses that can be used as-is or with some modifications. The goal is to save you some precious time so that you can get back to ~~work~~ wordle.
