Hi, thanks for reaching out and mentioning this exciting opportunity to be your company's first DevRel. My colleagues wrote [an excellent piece](https://thenewstack.io/youre-doing-it-wrong-recruiting-a-devrel/) on the challenges of the first DevRel hire. Could you please give this a read and get back with your thoughts on the questions posed there? In particular, I'd like to understand:

1. Why does your company need a developer advocate?

2. How do you see a developer advocate being different from a sales engineer or a solutions engineer?

3. Do you have a developer marketing strategy defined? What are reasonable KPIs for DevRel at your company?

4. Do you see the first DevRel building their own team in the future? If so, what are the success metrics for the team to grow beyond the first DevRel hire?

I know that I'm throwing a lot of questions at you. But this is only because I'm passionate about the work I do and I take my commitments very seriously. 

Thanks for understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you.
